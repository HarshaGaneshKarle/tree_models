# Decision Trees & Random Forests – Heart Disease Classification ❤️

## ✅ What I Did:
- Used the Heart Disease dataset
- Trained a Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Limited tree depth to control overfitting
- Evaluated both using accuracy, precision, recall
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation

## 🔍 Results:
- Decision Tree CV Accuracy: ~XX%
- Random Forest CV Accuracy: ~XX%
- Random Forest performed better and was less prone to overfitting

## 📊 Visuals:
- `decision_tree.png` – Tree visualization
- `feature_importance.png` – Top features

## 💡 Key Insights:
- Random Forest reduces variance using ensemble learning
- `cp`, `thalach`, and `oldpeak` were top predictors
